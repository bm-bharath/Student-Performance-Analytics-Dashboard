## 📊 Insights Discovered

🔹 Students studying 10+ hours/week show notable score improvement
🔹 Attendance below 60% strongly correlates with lower performance
🔹 Kinesthetic learners display higher engagement but inconsistent outcome
🔹 Visual learners show more stable performance averages
🔹 High stress does NOT equate to better scores
🔹 Motivation improves results only when matched with study consistency
