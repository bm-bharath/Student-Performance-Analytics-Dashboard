##  📌 Insights Discovered

🔹 Students studying 10+ hours/week show notable grade improvement
🔹 Attendance below 60% strongly correlates with low scores
🔹 Kinesthetic learners engage more but are inconsistent performers
🔹 Visual learners maintain better average scores
🔹 High stress ≠ high performance (curve collapses after threshold)
🔹 Motivation drives improvement only when matched with study discipline
